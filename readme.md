# Projet scientifique collectif(PSC) 

Sep. 2018 - May. 2019

This project is under the supervision of Renault and Departement of mathematics and Management in Ã‰cole Polytechnique, 
concerns the optimisation of robot-taxi service(driveless, electrical, sharing, dynamic dispatching). According to the ambition of Renault, 
we may be able to see robot-taxi serve in Paris in 2022.

Our works focused on the fleet-sizing and pricing, composed of two parts: Mathematical modeling and JAVA simulation. 
What you see here is the Java simulation.

### The model:

The city is segmented into a square grid, clients appear randmoly according to a Poisson Process at each node. A dispatching algorithme is in charge of manoeuvring taxis and deciding how to share a ride between clients.


### Some demonstrations of our results:

3.

Combining the result of mathematical modeling and this simulation, it turns out that we need 8600 robot-taxis to satisfy all clients instead of the current number 16000!
