This project is under the supervision of Renault and Departement of mathematics and Management in Ã‰cole Polytechnique, 
concerns the optimisation of robot-taxi service(driveless, electrical). According to the ambition of Renault, 
we may be able to see robot-taxi serve in Paris in 2022.

Our works focused on the fleet-sizing and pricing, composed by two parts: Mathematical modeling and JAVA simulation. 
What you see here is the Java simulation.

Here are some demonstration of our results:
